An exercise in TDD.  This example was taken from
"Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development"

The branch krisTest was my own walk through the problem, I tried to 
capture a commit after every failed test, then making the test pass to
help show the steps to getting the resulting answer.

Master branch has the final answer we came up with as a group
in the mob coding lunch and learn session.
